# BFS Player – EDA Assignment (FIB)

This repository contains the implementation of a **player based on the BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm** for the game developed in the course **EDA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** at the **Facultat d’Informàtica de Barcelona (FIB - UPC)**.

The code corresponds only to the **player logic**, implemented as part of an academic assignment.

## Algorithm
The player makes its decisions using the **BFS algorithm**, which explores the state space level by level in order to find shortest paths in the game board.

## Repository Contents
- BFS-based player implementation
- Decision-making logic based on level-order exploration

## Notes
- This repository **does not include the game engine or the official assignment statement**.
- The code is intended to be integrated into the framework provided by the course.

## Academic Context
Developed for the course **EDA – FIB (UPC)** for educational purposes only.
